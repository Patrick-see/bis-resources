## Project Doanload and Usage

This project contains sample files and templates. You usually need to download them, adjust them and then use them as describe in the associated manuals (see the `README.md` file in each directory).

You can either copy the file content in your Browser. For this it is recommended to use the **Raw** button on each Github page for easy copy.

If you need multiple files and want to keep track of changes, we recommend to use a `git` command line client and clone the project to your local project directory. You can visit the [Github Getting Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories) section, if you are new to Git.

If you do not want to deal with Git, Github also offers you a **Download ZIP** option on the same menu. Make sure to check for updated files regularly.
